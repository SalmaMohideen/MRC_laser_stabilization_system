Fort first time running the program (Using a New Computer): 

1. Ensure that you plug in the controller to a free USB port and that the controller is powered on
2. Would be best to keep the same port consistent and keep plugging it into the same port 
3. If it is a Windows Computer you must correct the baudrate which the port settings automatically set to

    Start Menu --> Device Manager --> View (3rd option on Menu Bar) -->  Ports (COM & LPT)
    Then you will click on the device under the list of Ports 
    Recognize which adress it has (ie: COM1, COM4 etc)
    This address will be needed to connect to the device and should be reset as the DEFAULT_PORT_ADDRESS under the main.py file (LINE 16)
    Right click on the correct port ---> Device properties --> Port Settings Tab
    Then go to select Bits/Second Dropdown menu and select 1152600
    Click OK
    Then verify that the settings were updated for this port. 
    Also briefly verify that DataBits = 8, Parity = One, StopBits = 1, and FlowControl = None
4. The settings should now be correct and should remain the same each time the device is connected/disconnected




5. Retreive the Code and open it in Visual Studio

Go gitHub repository and access the download and open the code in VScode 
gitHub link 


6. Activte a virtual environment to run the program in. 

For Windows devices, type the following command into terminal:  
python -m venv .venv

For macOS/Linux, type the following commands into the VScode terminal:
You may need to run: -get install python3-venv 
python3 -m venv .venv

Then select yes, when asked if you want to activate the virtual environment. 
Or manually change the interpereter to be the path of the new virtual envirnment. 

For more help with activating a .venv follow the link below: 
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/

7. Install pySerial in the vrtual environment
Type the following command into the terminal and press enter:

pip install pyserial



Warnings/Troubleshooting:  

If the device is connected but it is showing the error that device not connected please ensure that the controller is ON 

If the active stabilization light is not coming on after being activated, or the active light is not one or both stages
Then the intensity of the beam may not be enough to be recognized, this may cause out of range errors or an inability to initiate active stabilization. 
Use the side of the detectors to lower intensity untill more than 7/10 power lights appear on the back of the detector.  

If controller seems to b connected but will not send and receive commands 
Please ensure that the port is eing opened with correct format: 
Lines 45/46 of the serial_setup.py must be the following: 


ser = serial.Serial(self.name, bytesize=serial.EIGHTBITS, parity=serial.PARITY_NONE, stopbits=serial.STOPBITS_ONE, timeout = 1, write_timeout=1, rtscts=False, dsrdtr=False, xonxoff= True,inter_byte_timeout = 1, exclusive= None)  
ser.baudrate = 115200 

Also ensure that the port settings under the Windows Device Manager align with the above settings
rtscts=False, dsrdtr=False indicate that Flow Control setting should be off 


If the program stop because of a LiveStream error, please end the program and restart
LiveStream errors may occure if the beam becomes out of range, then the data does not follow correct format and can cause errors
